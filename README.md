# Node Review

## npm

`npm` is the Node Package Manager. It ships with node, we run it with the command line `npm`. We use npm for:

    - Initializing a nodejs project (makes `package.json`)
    - Installing packages (like `express`)
    - Running scripts in your project (`npm start` will run the right file)
    - Managing meta data for your project (github information, author names, description, version, etc)
